Traffic has been one of the major problems in Kathmandu valley even though there are traffic lights installed in different parts of Kathmandu, lights are still not used properly and are handled manually by the traffic police. Having traffic lights installed but not using them properly is making us lose not only money in lights but also the manpower that is being used in the process of managing traffic manually as it is today. It also hampers the economical as well as the environment with the high consumption of fuel and production of the carbon monoxide.And the major problem right now in Nepal is the polluted air, in such condition traffic officials have to deal with the traffic flow and  even couldnâ€™t use the Mask for the protection as they are controlling the traffic blowing the whistle.
Addressing those problems and issues FlowSync has aimed to manage the traffic by automating the lights with the help of computer vision which calculate the traffic density and dynamically adjust the traffic signals at the intersection.
