            FlowSync project highlights the challenges and issues faced in traditional traffic management systems, particularly in Nepal's urban areas. 
            It addresses key concerns such as traffic congestion, manual traffic control, fuel consumption, carbon emissions, and air pollution. 
            Traditional methods often lead to inefficient traffic flow, increased travel times, and heightened environmental impact due to excessive vehicle 
            idling. Additionally, manual traffic management poses risks to the safety of both motorists and pedestrians, especially in congested intersections.
