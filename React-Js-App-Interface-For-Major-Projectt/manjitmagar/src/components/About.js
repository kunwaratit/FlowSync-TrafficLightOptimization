          FlowSync utilizes cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to analyze traffic patterns in real-time. Cameras installed 
          at intersections monitor traffic density and flow. This data is processed to dynamically adjust the traffic signals, 
          optimizing the duration of green and red lights based on the current traffic conditions. The system ensures that 
          high-density traffic areas are given priority, reducing wait times and improving overall traffic movement.
